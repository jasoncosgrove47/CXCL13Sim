This repository contains LymphSim, a 3D simulation of a lymph node cortex. Includes collisions, chemotaxis, random movement and diffusion.


Uses:

* Mason v19 (required)
* jzy3d 0.9.1 (optional)

Note: the MASON code needs to be modified and recompiled do to errors with the graphing code. See https://listserv.gmu.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=mason-interest-l;ebfb7935.1509

(optional) dependencies are not required to run the simulation. (required) dependencies will cause the simulation to crash when missing, but some may be able to be disabled.
